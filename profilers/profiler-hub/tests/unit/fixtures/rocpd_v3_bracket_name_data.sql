-- Synthetic v3 bracket-in-name counter fixture data (profiler-hub task 063)
-- Coverage cell A3 x delimiter-in-name (task 062 audit).
-- =============================================================================
-- WHY THIS EXISTS:
--   ranked_pmc_resolver strips the agent ordinal " [N]" from a v3 counter track's
--   name_id string by cutting at the FIRST " [":
--       instr(str.string, ' [') > 0
--         ? substr(str.string, 1, instr(str.string, ' [') - 1)
--         : str.string
--   That is correct only when the metric base name contains no " [" of its own
--   (e.g. "device_busy_gfx [0]" -> "device_busy_gfx"). When the metric name itself
--   contains " [" (here "TCC_HIT [sum]"), the strip cuts at the WRONG bracket:
--   "TCC_HIT [sum] [0]" -> "TCC_HIT", which matches NEITHER pmc name, so the
--   name-match rank collapses and every co-sampled pmc ties at rank-key 1. This is
--   the LATENT degradation graded by task 062: the name key no longer selects the
--   pmc; only the deterministic pmc_id tiebreaker (ORDER BY ... , pe.pmc_id) does.
--
--   This fixture is crafted so the CORRECT pmc (TCC_HIT [sum]) has the LOWER pmc_id
--   (id=1) than its co-sampled sibling (TCC_MISS [sum], id=2). The tiebreaker
--   therefore still resolves the track to the right pmc -- the degradation is
--   non-fatal on this shape. The paired test asserts that GREEN result and documents
--   that the outcome now rides on pmc_id ordering, not the (defeated) name match: had
--   the correct pmc carried the higher id, the resolver would mis-rank.
--
-- HOW IT IS BUILT (see tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt):
--   {{uuid}} / {{guid}} substituted against the canonical v3 schema, then fed
--   through the sqlite3 CLI (same mechanism as the v3 amb-pmc fixture). No
--   rocpd_timestamp table is inserted, so the reader selects the v3 backend.
--
-- DATA SHAPE:
--   nid/pid columns in child tables are FK row-ids, NOT raw nid/pid values.
--   * 1 GPU agent (id=1, type_index=0) -- matches the " [0]" ordinal in the name
--   * 2 PMC types, both with " [" in the base name:
--       pmc id=1 = "TCC_HIT [sum]"   (the track's own metric; LOWER id)
--       pmc id=2 = "TCC_MISS [sum]"  (a co-sampled sibling; higher id)
--   * 1 counter track (id=10), name_id -> string "TCC_HIT [sum] [0]"
--   * 1 event (id=1) co-sampling BOTH pmcs (the AMD-SMI fan-out)
--   * 1 sample on the track referencing that event -> track classified as counter
--   Expected: the track resolves to pmc id=1 "TCC_HIT [sum]" via the pmc_id
--             tiebreaker, and its Q9 display name is "TCC_HIT [sum]".
